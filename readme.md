# Quote Generator

## Project Objectives

For this project, you will build a quote generator program. 

Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. 

This quote generator is going generate inspirational messages, however, youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. 

To make this program truly random, the message that it outputs is going to be made up of at least three different pieces of data.

The project kanban board can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/LRDe4bh2/message-generator)
